# Sniffthat
SniffThat is a pocket pc software based on the Compact Framework 2.0.
 
SniffThat allows to scan for wireless access points and combine this information with the current GPS position of the device.
 
It is plugin based and therefore supports custom plugins to do whatever the plugin likes to do with the access point and / or Gps Information.
